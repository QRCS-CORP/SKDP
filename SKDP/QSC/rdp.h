* Provides access to either the Intel RDRAND entropy provider.
* This provider is not recommended for stand alone-use, but should be combined 
* with another entropy provider to seed a MAC or DRBG function to provide quality
* random output.
* The ACP entropy provider is the recommended provider in this library.
